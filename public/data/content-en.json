    "title": "About Our Doctor",
    "name": "Specialist Dr. Soner Çağatay",
    "bio": "I graduated from Ankara University Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in 2003. I started my specialization training in the Department of Surgery at the same university in 2006. In 2007, I was appointed as a staff assistant in the Department of Traumatology and Orthopedic Surgery. As Dr. Soner Çağatay, I received the title of Science Specialist in 2009 and Doctor of Veterinary Surgery (PhD) in 2015. During this time, I personally performed surgical operations and gained high experience in surgical operation knowledge. Also during this period, I participated in clinical and scientific studies in Germany, the Netherlands, and many other countries. I attended the Medical Training course at Berlin Freie University and increased my knowledge and skills in small animal surgery. Post-doctorate, I carried out post-doctoral projects and studies at Ankara University. In 2017, I transferred to Near East University in the TRNC and shared my knowledge and skills with Cypriot veterinarian candidates. I actively managed surgical operations and taught the undergraduate Traumatology and Orthopedic Surgery course in both English and Turkish. As Veterinary Specialist Dr. Soner Çağatay, I continue to serve at PhD’s Veterinary Clinic in Antalya Liman Neighborhood with over 20 years of professional experience."
